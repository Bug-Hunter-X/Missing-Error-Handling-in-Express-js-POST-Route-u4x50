# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling in request processing.  The example shows a POST route that lacks error handling, leading to silent failures.  The solution demonstrates how to implement robust error handling to prevent unexpected behavior and improve application stability. 

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows a basic Express.js server with a POST route that accepts user data.  However, it lacks crucial error handling. If the request body is invalid (e.g., not properly formatted JSON), or if any database interaction or other operation fails, the server will not report the error.   The application will continue running, but without notifying the client or the developer about the failure.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates improved error handling.  It uses try...catch blocks to handle potential errors during processing.  Appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 500 for server errors) are returned to the client to convey the nature of the problem.  Error messages are logged for debugging purposes.

This example highlights the importance of comprehensive error handling for creating robust and reliable Express.js applications.  Always validate request data, handle potential exceptions, and provide informative error responses.
